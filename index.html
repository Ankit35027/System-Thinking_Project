            <h1>Welcome to Our System Thinking Hub</h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Welcome to our System Thinking Hub ‚Äî a space dedicated to exploring the power of systems thinking in understanding and solving complex real-world problems. In an age where everything is interconnected, linear thinking often falls short. System thinking offers a fresh, holistic perspective that enables individuals, teams, and organizations to see the bigger picture, uncover hidden patterns, and make more sustainable and impactful decisions.</p>
                <p>Our platform is built around the idea that many of today's challenges ‚Äî from environmental crises to mental health issues to digital addiction ‚Äî cannot be solved in isolation. They exist within broader systems of behavior, technology, society, and policy. By learning to map and analyze these systems, we can identify root causes, feedback loops, and leverage points that traditional methods might overlook.</p>
                <p>This site serves as a learning and collaboration space for students, educators, researchers, and problem-solvers who want to use system thinking to drive real change. Whether you're new to the concept or looking to deepen your understanding, we provide access to practical tools, case studies, models, and frameworks to help you apply systems thinking in various domains.</p>
                <p>Our current focus explores the issue of digital addiction among teenagers in India ‚Äî a growing concern with wide-ranging consequences on mental health, academic performance, and social well-being. Through a systems thinking approach, we aim to understand not just the symptoms but the structures and behaviors that reinforce this problem. By examining how education systems, family dynamics, peer pressure, digital platforms, and socio-economic conditions interact, we aim to develop insights and interventions that address the issue at its core.</p>

                    <p>The aim of this project is to apply systems thinking to deeply understand and address the complex issue of digital addiction among teenagers in India. As technology becomes increasingly embedded in everyday life, especially among the youth, excessive screen time and dependency on digital devices have begun to significantly affect teenagers' mental health, academic performance, physical well-being, and social relationships.</p>
                    <p>Through this project, we aim to move beyond surface-level observations and explore <b>the underlying structures, interdependencies, and feedback mechanisms</b> that contribute to digital addiction. This involves identifying not just the visible symptoms‚Äîsuch as decreased attention span, sleep disturbances, and social isolation‚Äîbut also the root causes and reinforcing loops, such as peer influence, algorithm-driven content, lack of parental awareness, inadequate digital education, and socio-economic drivers.</p>
                    <p>Using systems thinking tools such as <b>Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs), Stock and Flow Diagrams, and Behavior Over Time Graphs</b>, we will map the system to uncover how various factors interact over time. We will also conduct stakeholder analysis to understand the roles of parents, educators, policymakers, tech companies, and the teenagers themselves in shaping the digital environment.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="foot">By embracing a holistic and dynamic approach, our goal is not only to mitigate the immediate effects of digital addiction but to influence the system in ways that prevent its recurrence, promote digital well-being, and empower teenagers to use technology mindfully and responsibly.</p>

                <h2>Problem Identification & Initial Exploration</h2>
                <p>We began our inquiry with a critical observation: teenagers in India are spending an increasing amount of time on screens, particularly smartphones and social media platforms. This trend is linked to declining mental health, falling academic performance, and reduced physical and social activity.</p>
                <p>"What are the underlying causes and consequences of increasing screen time among Indian teenagers, and how can system thinking help in understanding and addressing this issue?</p>
                <p>To explore this, we adopted a systems thinking approach, moving beyond symptoms to understand the structure of the issue..</p>
